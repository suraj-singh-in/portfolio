My goal is to become one of the world’s leading Quantum-AI engineers and eventually build a company that creates real, practical quantum-accelerated intelligence systems.

                This project is my commitment to learning the deepest foundations of math, physics, quantum algorithms, machine learning, error correction, and quantum hardware — and then using that knowledge to build something the world has never seen.
